            <div className="testimonial-text">I had the pleasure of working with Dalmas at Engie Energy Access. 
                He is a highly motivated data engineer and a skilled data scientist 
                with exceptional attention to detail. Dalmas is not only easy to 
                collaborate with but also excels as a team player. His natural 
                leadership abilities shine through as he consistently steps up when 
                leadership is required.</div>
